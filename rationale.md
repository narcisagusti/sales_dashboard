RATIONALE

This document presents the design principles behind the enhanced Streamlit Sales Performance Dashboard (v2.0), grounded in cognitive principles, data visualization best practices, and bias mitigation strategies. Version 2.0 introduces granular data, advanced filters, new metrics (e.g., profit), and a structured tabbed layout for better analysis.
1.	Goal & Target User
Goal: Equip sales leaders, managers, and analysts with an interactive platform for in-depth performance analysis across time, geography, product, and sales teams. It aims to drive strategic decisions, identify opportunities, and optimize strategies.
User: Sales VPs, regional managers, product managers, operations analysts, and sales managers.
2.	Dashboard Structure: Tabs & Filters
Structure: A tabbed interface—"Overview," "Regional Analysis," "Product Performance," "Salesperson Insights," and "Detailed Data"—enables focused exploration.
Global Filters: Year, Quarter, Region, Product Category, Sub-Category, and Salesperson.
Cognitive Principles:
-	Information Chunking: Tabs reduce cognitive overload by isolating analysis areas.
-	Progressive Disclosure: "Detailed Data" is accessed only when needed, maintaining clarity.
-	Anchoring Bias Mitigation: Global filters default to "All," avoiding preset biases.

3.	Enhanced Metrics & Visualizations
New Metrics: Sub-Category, Salesperson, COGS, Profit, and Profit Margin (%) for deeper causal analysis.
Overview Tab Visuals:
-	KPIs (Revenue, Profit, Avg. Profit Margin) for situational awareness.
-	Line Charts for trend analysis and target comparisons.
-	Treemaps and Pie Charts for category breakdowns and regional insights.
Regional, Product, and Salesperson Tabs:
-	Bar Charts for revenue and profit comparisons.
-	Scatter Plots for multidimensional analysis (e.g., Units Sold vs. Profit Margin).

4.	Cognitive & Bias Mitigation Principle

-	Cognitive Offloading: Filters and pre-calculated metrics simplify analysis.
-	Attention Management: Clean layout and logical grouping focus attention.
-	Confirmation & Availability Bias Mitigation: Multiple views encourage deeper exploration beyond initial assumptions.
-	Consistent Visual Language: Repeated chart types for faster learning and recognition.

5.	Data-Ink Ratio & Chart Selection
Visualizations prioritize clarity and minimize non-data ink. Chart types are deliberately chosen for appropriateness—bar charts for comparisons, line charts for trends, and treemaps for hierarchical data.
The enhanced dashboard aims to deliver actionable insights through intuitive design, enabling better, data-driven decision-making.
